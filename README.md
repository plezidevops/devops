# 100 Days Of DevOps Challenge

Welcome to my 100 days DevOps Challenges!

I'm committed one hour, every day, for the next 100 days going DevOps related work.

## My Rules

1. I will push my works to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.

2. I will update my [Activity Log](log.md) with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.

## Contents

The stuff I create, such as diagrams, scripts, installation manuals will be stored here. It will contain invaluable documents for others who wishes to duplicate my work can use:

- [Activity Log](log.md)
- [Resources](resources.md)
