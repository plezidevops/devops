### Learning just for fun!!!

DevOps has always fascinating me, but I never **created** the time to concentrate on it. This time I am! I am using a new strategy to experiment with it one bit every day. This is my 1-hour a day project. The plan is simple: **learn and document what I have learned**.

## DevOps and Tools

---

### Day 1 (10/12/23) - Devops's tools and their roles

**Focus**: Today's learning focuses on devops tools

**Progress**:

- The roles each tool plays during the implementation phase of an application
- These tools include:
  - Prometheus
  - git
  - terraform
  - GiiHub
  - docker
  - grafana
  - jenkins
  - kubernetes
  - ansible
- Understanding the application workflow from development to deployment

**Thoughts**: Today's learning is understanding the application development process and how the various DevOps tools make it possible. Each one of these tools play an important role in the flow of things. The learning today tells a story of how you start with a simple application. As you expand the application you see how each tool comes into play in the development, collaboration, and deployment of the application. In the end designing an infrastructure for the application that benefits everyone. It was fun.

**Work & Resources**:

- NONE
