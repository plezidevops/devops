### Day 1 - Virtual Machine

**Focus**: Today's learning focus was on Virtual Machine

**Progress**:

- Installing Ubuntu Linux version 20.04
- Installing VitualBox and Vagrant
- Using vagrant to create a centos virtual server
- getting familiar with the vagrant commands
- Learn about type 1 and 2 hypervisor

**Thoughts**: Today learniing was super hands-on. It was create a joy playing installing different OSes on the host computer. I installed a web server, creating a public network, and access the web server from another computer. That was fun.
