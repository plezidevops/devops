### Learning just for fun!!!

DevOps has always fascinating me, but I never created the time to concentrate on it. This time I am! I am using a new strategy to experiment with it one bit every day.

## DevOps and Tools

### Day 1 (6/21/23) - Devops's tools and their roles

**Focus**: Today's learning focuses on devops tools

**Progress**:

- The roles each tool plays during the implementation phase of an application
- These tools include:
  - Prometheus
  - git
  - terraform
  - GiiHub
  - docker
  - grafana
  - jenkins
  - kubernetes
  - ansible
- Understanding the application workflow from development to deployment

**Thoughts**: Today's learning is on understanding various DevOps tools and their roles in an organization infrastructure. The learning today tells a story of how you start with a simple application. As you expand the application you see how each tool comes into play (to design an infrastructure for the application). It was fun.

**Work & Resources**:

- NONE
