### Day 1 - Virtual Machine

**Focus**: Today's learning focus was on Virtual Machine

**Progress**:

- Installing Ubuntu Linux version 20.04
- Installing VirtualBox and Vagrant
- Using vagrant to create a centos virtual server
- getting familiar with the vagrant commands
- Learn about type 1 and 2 hypervisor

**Thoughts**: Today's learning was super hands-on. It was create a joy playing installing different OSes on the host computer. I installed a web server, creating a public network, and access the web server from another computer. That was fun.

### Day 2 - Linux

**Focus**: Today's learning focus on understanding the Linux Operating system

**Progress**:

- Setting up a Raspberry pi 4 with Ubuntu server 20.04
- Understanding what an Operating System is 
- User --> Operating System --> Hardware
- Getting to know the Linux File System Hierarchy
- Getting familiar with the Linux shell commands
- The Linux boot process

**Thoughts**: Today's learning was more theoretical in nature. It was a joy reviewing the the boot process, kernel, init, process management, scheduling, etc. Login to the Ubuntu linux shell and navigate to different part of the file system. playing with command such dmesg, cat /proc/cpuinfo, etc. I had lots of fun.
